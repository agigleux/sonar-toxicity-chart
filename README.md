## Description / Features ##

This plugin is an implementation of the **Toxicity Chart** visualization technique presented by Erik DÃ¶rnenburg on his blog, [here](http://erik.doernenburg.com/2008/11/how-toxic-is-your-code/) and [here](http://erik.doernenburg.com/2013/06/toxicity-reloaded/). This technique is useful to quickly get an idea of the general quality of a large existing code base. **Toxicity Charts** stack multiple static analysis metrics for classes, methods, or components within an application, providing a combined *toxicity score* for each area of the code base. This can be extremely useful in helping managers and non-developers understand the internal quality of the code.

Toxicity Chart for **Hibernate** (Java)

![Toxicity Chart - Java](https://4d7f3ccfc784b13605de2780f0f4bf21ee2162f6.googledrive.com/host/0B9tMA3RbZ5P_VS11Nk0yWkpNeXM/toxicity_chart_screenshot.png)

Toxicity Chart for **NHibernate** (C#)

![Toxicity Chart - C#](https://4d7f3ccfc784b13605de2780f0f4bf21ee2162f6.googledrive.com/host/0B9tMA3RbZ5P_VS11Nk0yWkpNeXM/toxicity_chart_csharp.png)

In a **Toxicity Chart** each bar represents a class and the height of the bar shows the toxicity score for that class.  The score is based on a set of rules rules (see [Usage & Installation](#usageAndInstallation) section) and different colours are used to represent each one. This makes it possible to easily spot not only how toxic a code base is, but also how the problems are distributed and what the preponderant *code smell* is. The classes that score zero points are left off the chart. The metrics are computed using the threshold value set for corresponding rule from **SonarQube / C# SonarQube** repositories.

![Rules configuration](https://4d7f3ccfc784b13605de2780f0f4bf21ee2162f6.googledrive.com/host/0B9tMA3RbZ5P_VS11Nk0yWkpNeXM/activate_rule.png)

For example if the Method Length metric has a threshold of **30** and a class comprises three methods, one that is **25** lines, one that is **45** lines and another that is **60** lines long, then the score is calculated to be proportional to the length of the method in relation to the threshold and for the given scenario the class gets **1.5 + 2 = 3.5** points.

## Axes of quality ##

All the metrics are computed using the approach presented above.

**File Length**

Total of points accumulated due to the violation of *File Length* rule. The possible associated technical debts are: Understandability, Maintainability and Single Responsibility Principle violation.

**Method Length**

Total of points accumulated due to the violation of *Method Length* rule. The possible associated technical debts are: Understandability, Maintainability and Single Responsibility Principle violation.

**Cyclomatic Complexity**

Total of points accumulated due to the violation of *Cyclomatic Complexity* rule. The possible associated technical debts are: Understandability, Maintainability and Testability.

**Parameter Number**

Total of points accumulated due to the violation of *Parameter Number* rule. The possible associated technical debts are: Understandability, Maintainability and Testability.

**Boolean Expression Complexity**

Total of points accumulated due to the violation of *Boolean Expression Complexity* rule. The possible associated technical debts are: Understandability, Maintainability and Testability.

**Nested If Depth**

Total of points accumulated due to the violation of *Nested If Depth* rule. The possible associated technical debts are: Understandability, Maintainability and Testability.

**Nested Try Depth**

Total of points accumulated due to the violation of *Nested Try Depth* rule. The possible associated technical debts are: Understandability, Maintainability and Testability.

**Missing Switch Default**

Total of points accumulated due to the violation of *Missing Switch Default* rule. The possible associated technical debt is: Correctness.

**Class Fan Out Complexity**

Total of points accumulated due to the violation of *Class Fan out Complexity* rule. The possible associated technical debts are: Understandability, Maintainability, Testability and High Coupling.


**Anon Inner Length**

Total of points accumulated due to the violation of SonarQube Anon Inner Length rule. The possible associated technical debt is: Maintainability.
Average value

Total of points accumulated due violation of all above rules divided by the number of classes that score more than one point.

## Installation ##

1. Download the plugin into the *SONARQUBE_HOME/extensions/plugins* directory
2. Restart the **SonarQube** server

## Usage ##

1. Make sure the **SonarQube / C# SonarQube Rules** listed below are enabled in your profile and that the threshold values are set appropriately.
2. Launch a new quality analysis to calculate the metrics.

The table below lists the **Squid** rules that should be enabled in order to generate the **Toxicity Chart**.

If the number of classes that score more than one point is greater than 125, then the numbers on the X axis will overlap each other. In order to make the chart readable in this situation the **Toxicity Chart** threshold value can be changed in *Configuration > General Settings > Toxicity Chart* panel. The classes that have the score below the threshold value are left off the chart. The threshold value is not taken into account in toxicity metrics computing.
